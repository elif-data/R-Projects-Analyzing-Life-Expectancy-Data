# Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy (R, ggplot2)

We'll be working with a dataset that contains the average life expectancies of men and women from around the world. It covers 195 countries,and 4 periods which are 985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005.


Using visualizations, we can start to explore 2 questions from the dataset:

  1. How does the average life expectancy of men and women differ across countries between "2000-2005".
  2. How does the average life expectancy of men and women differ across countries between "1985-1990" and "2000-2005". 
  

Implementation of a DataCamp project hosted by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón.
