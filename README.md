# Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy (R, ggplot2)

We'll be working with a dataset that contains the average life expectancies of men and women from around the world. It covers 195 countries,and 4 periods which are 985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005.

Using visualizations, we can start to explore 2 questions from the dataset:

  1. How does the average life expectancy of men and women differ across countries between "2000-2005".
  2. How does the average life expectancy of men and women differ across countries between "1985-1990" and "2000-2005". 

I have uploaded my code from R but if you'd like to see it in jupyter notebook please check out [my workspace on datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/7e1fbd84-5441-46a6-9e0d-6eddfe716651/edit/).
